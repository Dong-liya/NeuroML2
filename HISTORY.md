v2beta1 / 2013-XX-XX
--------------------

* Moved schema to beta1

* Modified `<segment>` to ensure its id is only ever a non negative integer. 
   Required defining a BaseWithoutId element. Requested by Subhasis Ray, who 
   pointed out the type of the seg ids should be the same in `<segment id=X>` 
   and `<parent segment=X>`.

* networkWithTemperature??

* Connections with segment ids & fraction along

* Restructure of NMDA/STP synapses
